# numworks chess

An attempt at making a chess engine for numworks calculators.

## Installation

```bash
make run
```

## Cool stuff in this repo:

- [chess-library](https://github.com/Disservin/chess-library) ported to work with c++11 standard
- move pregenerator
- Cool workarounds for numworks limitations


## Brick wall:

When launching tests for the first move it correctly says 20 legal moves; But on numworks it says 0 legal moves;
